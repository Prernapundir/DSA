### Types of Graph 
- Directed Graph : Where all the edges are directed and there can be multipe directed edges.

- Undirected Graph : Where edges are bidirectional and no direction

### Cycles in Graph
When cycle ocurs in graph : When we start from one node and ends on that node 
- Directed Cyclic Graph

### Degree in a Graph
- Degree in Undirected Graph : Number of edges attached to a node
  - Total degree of graph = 2 * number of edges { because every node is associated with two nodes } 
- Degree in Directd Graph : 
  - Indgree of node: Number of incoming edges
  - Outdegree : Number of outgoing edges

### Edge Weight 
When edges having the weight
